# mdeGranular

This is mdeGranular~, a real-time, multi-channel, multi-voice,
multi-transposition granular synthesis external for Max/MSP and PD.

For archives of the various builds for each architecture, see [builds](./builds).

If you're having problems with Mac M1 computers (e.g. mdeGranular~: unable to load 
object bundle executable), open the terminal application, cd to the directory
where you're keeping the external and run `codesign --force --deep -s - mdeGranular~.mxo`

mdeGranular's binaries get continously built through GitHub Actions.
You can find precompiled binaries readily available under this
repository's [Actions](../../actions)
tab. Just click on the latest 'workflow run' and you'll see the latest 
external objects listed under 'Artifacts'. NB **You have to be logged
in to github in order to access these**, so you'll need to make an account
first. There are also archives of these builds for each platform in the builds folder.

mdeGranular~.mxe64 = Max on Windows  
mdeGranular~.mxo = Max on Mac  
mdeGranular~.pd_linux = PD on Linux  
mdeGranular~.dll = PD on Windows  
mdeGranular~.pd_darwin = PD on Mac

Help files for both PD and MaxMSP may be found in the 'pd' or
'max' subdirectories respectively.

Documentation is on the [wiki](../../wiki).

## Compilation

Github actions should now take care of compilations (many thanks to the brilliant Ren√©-Maurice
Hanne for this!). However if you want to use XCode yourself on a Mac, keep reading.

To compile for MaxMSP on OSX you'll need XCode and the most recent MaxSDK from [github](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-sdk)
