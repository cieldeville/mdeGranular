# mdeGranular

This is mdeGranular~, a real-time, multi-channel, multi-voice,
multi-transposition granular synthesis external for Max/MSP and PD.

mdeGranular's binaries get continously built through GitHub Actions.
You can find precompiled binaries readily available under this
repository's [Actions](https://github.com/mdedwards/mdeGranular/actions)
tab (see 'Build All' workflow). Just click on the latest workflow run and y
ou'll see the latest external objects listed under Artifacts.

For Pure Data
precompiled binaries are available on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.
Precompiled binaries for Max MSP are available on Mac OSX and
Windows. Please note that the provided binaries are only compatible
with 64-bit systems.

Help files for both PD and MaxMSP may be found in the 'pd' or
'max' subdirectories respectively.

Documentation is on the [wiki](../../wiki).

## Compilation

Github actions should now take care of compilations (many thanks to the brilliant Ren√©-Maurice
Hanne for this!). However if you want to use XCode yourself on a Mac, keep reading.

To compile for MaxMSP on OSX you'll need XCode and the most recent 
[MaxSDK](https://cycling74.com/sdk/max-sdk-8.0.3/html/index.html).
There's a sample XCode project in the max folder. This was created for Max SDK
8.0.3 using XCode 11.3.1. It will not work directly as is, rather, you need to
put the xcode folder (containing mdegranular~.xcodeproj) into the MaxSDK folder
"source/audio" alongside the MaxMSP example projects. From there it should build
against the MaxMSP libraries.
