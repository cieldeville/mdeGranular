18/6/20:
   * gcc #pragmas etc. for compilation on Linux for PD
   * Linux PD external now on github
27/2/20: 1.2
   * updated to Max API/SDK 8.0.3
   * corrected bug that was causing object to crash when DSP turned on and no
   arguments  were given
   * updated PD code and enabled compilation for PD via pd-lib-builder
   * prepared code base etc. for Githib open-source release

19/9/13: 1.1
    * updated to Max API 6.1.3: fairly hefty changes to make the object work in
    the now 64 bit float (double) MSP environment.  Most changes reflect new
    buffer accessing framework.  The MSP buffer~ is still 32 bit (for backward
    compatibility) so if granulating a static buffer~, its samples are first
    copied over and promoted to 64 bit.  This will mean that if you change the
    contents of the buffer~ there will be no difference to the granulator's
    output until you reuse the set message again.
    * 3/10/11: added BufferGrainRamp message/method
    * 19/5/11: fixed bug that caused crash on reinitialisation of object

14/9/10: 1.06:
    * made some changes to allow resumption of previous state (without crashes)
      when the DSP is turned off and back on again 
    * migrated project to latest SDK (5.1.1)

1.05: 
    * fixed a bug that caused a crash when quickly changing ramp lengths from
      very long to short;
    * added the Portion, PortionWidth, and PortionPosition messages to more
      easily control buffer granulation points; 
    * made the ms prefix to setting live buffer sizes no longer necessary by
      introducing the setms message e.g.  'setms 2000' instead of 'set ms2000'
      (but ms prefix still works);
    * handled the post bug that in Max5 refuses to add new lines (thus screwing
      up warning/error messages); 
    * fixed bug in grain start/end setting that added current live index even
      when we were processing a static buffer;  
    * separated out the maxmsp and pd interface parts into separate c files
      and created a common header.


1.04: 
    * added Warnings message to turn on/off printing to max window (for Kim
      Cascone ;)  

1/5/08: 1.03: 
    * added OctaveSize and OctaveDivisions messages for non-standard tunings 

17/4/08: 1.02: 
    * fixed bug that stopped grain amplitude from reaching 0 

3/4/08: 1.01: 
    * added OSX USB support 
    * fixed RAND_MAX bug in between function
